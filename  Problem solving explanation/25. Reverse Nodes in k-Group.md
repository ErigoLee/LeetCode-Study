## Reverse Nodes in K-Group — Algorithm Explanation
This function reverses nodes in a linked list k at a time.

Example (k=2):
``` Markfile
Input:  1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5  
Output: 2 → 1 → 4 → 3 → 5
```
Only full groups of `k` nodes are reversed.

## Core idea
I process the list in groupes of K nodes.
For each group:
    1. Collect `k` nodes
    2. Reverse their order
    3. Append them to the result list
If there are fewer than `k` nodes left, we stop reversing and keep them as they are.


## Step 1 - Take k nodes
``` python
stack = []
for _ in range(k):
    if head == None:
        notCompleted = True
        break
    stack.append(head)
    head = head.next
```
I use a stack to temporarily store `k` nodes. </br>
If I cannot collect `k` nodes, notCompleted becomes True. </br>

## Step 2 - If fewer than k nodes remain
``` python
if notCompleted == True:
    if current == None:
        return head
    else:
        current.next = stack[0]
        break
```
If there are not enough nodes:
1. I do not reverse them
2. I connect the remaining nodes to the result
3. I stop the loop

## Step 3 — Reverse the group
``` python
while len(stack) > 0:
    current = ListNode(stack.pop().val)
    if new_head == None:
        new_head = current
    if prev != None:
        prev.next = current
    prev = current
```
Since a stack pops in reverse order, this creates the nodes in reversed order.
I link the reversed nodes into the final list.
