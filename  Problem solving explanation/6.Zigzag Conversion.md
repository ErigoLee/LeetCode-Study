## Zigzag Conversion

This algorithm creates rows equal to the number of `numRows` and inserts characters into each row.

- **`up`**
A boolean flag that indicates whether the `row` index should move upward or downward when inserting characters from string `s` into the rows.

### Direction Rules
* When `up == true`
    * Insert the character into rows[index]
    * Increment index (index++)

* When up == false
    * Insert the character into rows[index]
    * Decrement index (index--)
