## Merge K Sorted Lists — Algorithm Explanation
This program merges K sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

Each list is already sorted in ascending order, so the goal is to repeatedly take the smallest available value and build a new list.

## Why `value = 10001` in my code?
In this problem, every node value is guaranteed to be in the range:
``` diff
-10,000 ≤ value ≤ 10,000 
```
Therefore, `value = 10001` is a safe initial value because it is larger than any possible node value. </br>
This allows us to easily find the smallest number when comparing nodes.

## While Loop Logic
1. When does the loop stop? </br>
``` python
finished = True
for i in lists:
    if i != None:
        finished = False
        break
if finished == True
    break
``` 
**Answer:** When every list is `None`, it means there are no nodes left. </br>
At that time, the while loop finishes. </br> 

2. Finding the smallest value </br>
``` python
move_index = -1
for i in range(len(lists)):
    if lists[i] == None:
        continue
    if value > lists[i].val:
        value = lists[i].val
        move_index = i
``` 
Through the for loop, I find the smallest value and its index. </br>
If some nodes have the same smallest value, I choose the smaller index because we scan from left to right. </br>

3. Creating a new node
Once the smallest value is found:
``` python
current = ListNode()
current.val = value
lists[move_index] = lists[move_index].next
```
**Create a new node with that value**
**Move the selected list forward to its next node**
This means we consume one node from the chosen list.

4. Building the result list
I connect nodes one by one:
``` python
if head == None:
    head = current
if prev != None:
    prev.next = current
prev = current
```
• The first node becomes `head` </br>
• Every next node is connected using `prev.next`</br>

This builds the final merged linked list.</br>
