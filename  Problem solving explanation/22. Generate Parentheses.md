## Variable Definitions

The algorithm uses three state variables while generating valid parentheses.

- **`n`**  
  The total number of parenthesis pairs to generate.  
  The final output will contain exactly `n` opening parentheses `"("` and `n` closing parentheses `")"`.

- **`p`**  
  The number of opening parentheses `"("` that have been used so far in the current recursive state.

- **`m`**  
  The number of currently open parentheses that have not yet been closed.  


e.g
n = 3
