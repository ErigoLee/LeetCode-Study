## Swap Nodes in Pairs — Algorithm Explanation
This function swaps every two adjacent nodes in a linked list.
``` Markfile
Input:  1 → 2 → 3 → 4  
Output: 2 → 1 → 4 → 3
``` 

## How the algorithm works
We use three main pointers:

• `head` → points to the current position in the original list </br>
• `prev` → points to the last node of the new list </br>
• `new_head` → the head of the new swapped list </br>

Inside the loop, we always take two nodes at a time.

## Step 1 — Pick two nodes
``` python
first = head
second = head.next
``` 

• `first` is the current node </br>
• `second` is the next node </br>
These two will be swapped. </br>

## Step 2 - If only one node is left
``` python
if second == None and first != None:
    if prev != None:
        prev.next = first
    else:
        new_head = first
    break
```
If `second` is `None`, it means there is only one node left and it cannot be swapped. </br>
I just connect it to the previos node. Then I stop the loop

## Step 3 - Move the original head
``` python
head = head.next.next
``` 
This moves `head` forward by two nodes, preparing for the next pair.

## Step 4 - Create swapped nodes
We create new nodes in swapped order:
``` python
current = ListNode(second.val)
if prev != None:
    prev.next = current

prev = current
if new_head == None:
    new_head = current
current = ListNode(first.val)
prev.next = current
prev = current
```
So the order becomes: second → first
