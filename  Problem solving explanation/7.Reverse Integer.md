## Reverse Integer

This algorithm reverses the digits of an integer x by converting it to a string and applying slicing ([::-1]), while preserving the sign.

``` python
x_str = str(temp)
x_reverse = x_str[::-1]
result = int(x_reverse)
```

### Integer Range Validation
According to the problem constraints:
``` diff
-2^31 ≤ value ≤ 2^31
```
After reversing the integer, we check whether the result is within the valid 32-bit signed integer range.

* If the reversed value exceeds this range, the algorithm returns 0.
``` python
if result > pow(2,31) or result < pow(-2,31):
    return 0
``` 
This ensures that any value outside the allowed range is safely handled and prevents integer overflow.
