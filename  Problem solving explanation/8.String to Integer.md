## String to Integer

### Simple Explanation

First, the algorithm removes whitespace from the string using strip(). </br>
``` python
s = s.strip()
```

Then, it initializes variables to store the resulting number and its sign. </br>

If the first character is `-` or `+`, it is saved as the sign. </br>
    * `-` means negative
    * `+` means positive
``` python
if i == 0 and (s[i] == '-' or s[i] == '+'):
```

The algorithm then checks the next characters one by one. </br>
It keeps reading and saving digits.</br>
When a non-digit character appears, the algorithm stops. </br>
``` python
if s[i] >= '0' and s[i] <= '9':
    result += s[i]
else:
    break
```

Finally, it returns the number with the recorded sign. </br>
``` python
if negative == True:
    result_int = 0 - int(result)
    return result_int
else:
    result_int = int(result)            
    return result_int
```


### Integer Range Validation
``` diff
-2^31 ≤ value ≤ 2^31 - 1
```
The value is less than `-2^31` or greater than `2^31 - 1`. At that time, it is adjusted to `-2^31` or `2^31 - 1`
